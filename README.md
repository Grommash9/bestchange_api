Wrote api for bestchange. The algorithm of work - upload the info.zip file, unpack it into the database, from there we give it to the main database and give it to users via fapi. Poorly implemented input control due to the haste of implementation. Api is probably still available here https://rapidapi.com/Grommash9/api/bestchange/

The source code is posted for demonstration purposes.
